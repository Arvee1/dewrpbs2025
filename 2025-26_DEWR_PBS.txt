The purpose of the 2025–26 Portfolio Budget Statements  (PB Statements) is to inform Senators 
and Members of Parliament of the proposed allocation of resources to government 
outcomes by entities within the portfolio. Entities receive resources from the annual 
appropriations acts, special appropriations (including standing appropriations and special 
accounts), and revenue from other sources.  
A key role of the PB Statements is to facilitate the understanding of proposed annual 
appropriations in Appropriati on Bills (No. 1 and No. 2 ) 2025–2026 (or Appropriation 
(Parliamentary Departments ) Bill (No. 1 ) 2025–2026 for the parliame ntary departments ) 
and related Supply Bills where they exist applicable to the 2025 –26 Budget.  In this sens e, 
the PB Statements are Budget related papers and are declared by the Appropriation Acts to 
be ‘relevant documents ’ to the interpretation of the Acts according to sect ion 15AB of the 
Acts Interpretation Act 1901 . 
The PB Statements provide information, explanation and justification to enable Parliament 
to understand the purpose of each outcome proposed in the Bills.  
As required under section 12 of the Charter of Budget Honesty Act 1998 , only  entities within 
the general government sector are included as part of the Commonwealth general 
government sector fiscal estimates and produce  PB Statements  where they receive funding 
(either directly or via portfolio departments) through the annual appropriation acts .

The following diagram outlines the key components of the Commonwealth performance 
framework. The diagram identifies the content of each of the publications and the 
relationship between them. Links to the publications for each entity within the portfolio ca n

Section 1: Entity overview and reso urces  
1.1 Strategic direction statement  
The Department of Employment and Workplace Relations (the department) supports 
people in Australia to have safe, secure and well -paid work with the skills for a sustainable 
future.  
The department supports its Ministers through expert, evidence -based policy advice and 
through the design and delivery of effective policies and programs. We support people to 
access jobs and work with industry to get outcomes for participants in employmen t 
programs. The department jointly stewards the skills and training sector with the states and 
territories and works in close partnership with unions, employers, industry experts and 
training providers to deliver high quality skills for all Australians.  
The 2025 –26 Budget includes initiatives that focus on assisting with cost -of-living 
pressures, supporting the construction sector to ease housing pressures, and improving 
pathways and processes to build a skilled future workforce, building on the Governmen t’s 
Future Made in Australia plan . It also includes measures to provide additional regulatory 
supports to safeguard the integrity of the vocational education and training (VET) sector, 
and to ensure continuity of access to Workforce Australia services for retrenched workers 
and their partners.  
Increased support for apprentices  
On 24 January 2025, the Government announced additional investments in Australia’s 
apprenticeship system  as an initial response to the Strategic Review of the Australian 
Apprenticeship Incentive System .  
The Government will commit $77.8 million over four years to maintain  the 2025 Priority 
List and extend current Australian Apprentice Training Support and Priority Hiring 
Incentive payment settings by six months until 31 December 2025, ensuring apprentices in 
priority occupations and their employers remain eligible for up t o $5,000 in incentive 
payments. This will provide consistency for employers and cost -of-living relief to 
apprentices in priority occupations while the Government considers the review’s fin dings 
and consults with stakeholders on longer -term reforms.  
The Government is investing $626.9 million over four years to support  the skilled 
workforce development required to help achieve Australia’s housing commitments, 
through additional supports for apprentices working in housing construction. From 
1 July 2025, eligible apprentices will receive $10,000 in incentive payments, on top of their 
wages, over the life of their apprenticeship through the new Housing Construction 
Apprenticeship stream of the Key Apprenticeship Program. This reflects the importance of  
the construction sector by encouraging the growth of this critical workforce and expanding 
the pipeline of workers training in housing and construction apprenticeships.      |  Portfolio Budget Statements  
 
Page 14  |  Department of Employment and Workplace Relations   
The Government is also committing $7 .0 million over four years to increase the 
Living  Away from Home Allowance to $120 per week for first -year apprentices, $90 per 
week for second -year apprentices and $45  per week for third -year apprentices, so 
apprentices can meet the costs associated with moving to take up an apprenticeship. 
Funding of $11 million over f our years will also be committed to increase the 
Disability  Australian Apprentice Wage Support subsidy to $216.07 per week to support 
employers taking on apprentices with disability. Annual review checks for apprentices 
with permanent disability will also be removed to reduce administrative burden.  
The Government has also increased the number of TAFE Centres of Excellence being 
established under the National Skills Agreement (NSA) that are eligible to receive 
additional funding to fast -track their establishment.  
Addressing integrit y risks  
The Australian Skills Quality Authority will receive $4.7 million in 2025 –26 to undertake a 
surge in enforcement activity to respond to the fraudulent issuance of VET qualifications, to 
manage public safety risks and to protect the reputation of the VET sector.  
The Government will invest $1.3 million  over four years from 2025 –26 to extend the 
Early  Access initiative  to 30 June 2027 to continue providing retrenched workers and their 
partners  immediate access  to Workforce Australia provider s ervices , regardless of their 
eligibility for income support.  
Other priorities  
The Government will provide $1.9 million in 2025 –26 for the extension of a dedicated 
taskforce within the department, supporting the development of skills and training 
initiatives assisting in the delivery of Australia’s nuclear -powered submarine program.  
The Government will also temporarily reduce the Industry Workforce Training program 
funding in 2028 –29, with no impact on existing projects, creating saving s of $7.9 million.  
The Government will legislate to limit and regulate the use of non -compete clauses for low 
and middle -income earners through the Fair Work Act 2009  and remove loopholes in the 
Competition and Consumer Act 2010  that allow anti -competitive 'no -poach' and 'wage -fixing' 
arrangements between businesses without the knowledge and agreement of affected 
workers. The Government will undertake further consultation on policy and 
implementation details to support these refo rms.  
The Government will also work with state and territory governments, unions and 
employers  to design a national licensing scheme for electrical occupations, aimed at 
reducing red tape, improving labour mobility for licensees, and ensuring safety and terms 
and conditions. The Treasury is leading the development and consultation of the national 
scheme. The department will support the Treasury by providing policy advice and insights 
into the Mutual Recognition schemes and other systems that connect with licensing, 
including apprenticeships and nationally recognised training (training packages).  Portfolio Budget Statements  |

Section 2: Outcomes and planned  performance  
Government outcomes are the intended results, impacts or consequences of actions by the 
Government on the Australian community. Commonwealth programs are the primary 
vehicle by which government entities achieve the intended results of their outcome 
stateme nts. Entities are required to identify the programs which contribute to 
government outcomes over the Budget and forward years.  
Each outcome is described below together with its related programs. The following 
provides detailed information on expenses for each outcome and program, further broken 
down by funding source.  
The department will publish an updated suite of performance measures in the 2025 –26 
Department of Employment and Workplace Relations Corporate Plan.  
Note:  
Performance  reporting requirements in the Portfolio Budget Statements are part of the 
Commonwealth performance framework established by the Public Governance, 
Performance and Accountability Act 2013  (PGPA Act). It is anticipated that the performance 
measure described in Portfolio Budget Statements will be read with broader information 
provided in an entity’s corporate plans and annual performance statements – included in 
Annual Reports – to provide a  complete picture of an entity’s planned and actual 
performance.  
The most recent corporate plan for the Department of Employment and Workplace 
Relations (the department) can be found through:  www.dewr.gov.au .

Table 2. 3.3: Performance  measures  for Outcome 3 
Table 2.3.3 details the performance measures for each program associated with Outcome 3. 
It is used by entities to describe the results they plan to achieve and the related key 
activities, as detailed in the current corporate plan, the context in which the se activities are 
delivered, and how the performance of these activities will be measured. Where relevant, 
details of the 2025 –26 Budget measures that have created new programs or materially 
changed existing programs are provided.  
Outcome 3 – Facilitate jobs growth, including secure work, through policies and programs that 
promote fair, productive and safe workplaces.  
Program 3.1 – Workplace Support  
 
This program contributes to the outcome through:  
• the promotion of fair workplaces by ensuring the protection of employee entitlements in certain 
circumstances.  
• ensuring the efficient operation of the workplace relations system through initiative s designed to 
encourage employers and employees to adopt fair, productive, flexible and safe workplace relations.  
Key Activities  • Promote fair, productive and safe workplaces through policies and programs  
• Support the protection of workers’ entitlements

Section 3: Budgeted financial statements  
Section 3  presents budgeted financial statements which provide a comprehensive snapshot 
of entity finances for the 2025–26 budget year , including the impact of budget measures 
and resourcing on financial statements . 
3.1 Budgeted financial statements  
3.1.1 Differences between  entity resourcing and financial statements  
The entity resource statement may differ from the budgeted financial statements as a result 
of the entity resource statement being presented on a resourcing basis while the budgeted 
financial statements are based on Australian Accounting Standards.  
3.1.2 Explanatory notes and analysis of budgeted financial statements  
Analysis of the department’s budgeted financial statements, which consists of the budgeted 
departmental statements and administered schedules, is provided below.  The 202 4–25 
estimated actual is used as the comparative year.  
Budgeted departmental comprehensive income statement  
The department’s income statement reflects deficit s across the forward estimates. These  
deficits are predominantly attributed to depreciation and amortisation expenses, including 
the application of the lease accounting standard, AASB  16. 
Total expenses for 202 5–26 are estimated to be $ 940.5  million. This is a  decrease  of 
$110.1  million from the 202 4–25 estimated actual, mainly driven by decrease s in employee 
and supplier expenses.   
Budgeted departmental balance sheet  
The budgeted net asset position is $ 541.1  million as at 30 June 202 6. The accumulated deficit 
apparent in the balance sheet predominately represents the accounting treatment 
applicable to depreciation expenses and AASB 16 Leases.  
The structure of the balance sheet reflects the nature of the organisation. Key  assets  are 
office fit -out (included in land and buildings), computer software (included in intangibles) 
and computer and office machines (included in property, plant and equipment). The most 
significant liability relates to leases as a consequence of  AASB  16 Leases. Other significant 
liabilities relate to employees and the leave provisions that are accrued.   
Schedule of budgeted income and expenses administered on behalf of Government  
The schedule reflects the revenues/gains and expenses relating to the programs 
administered by the department on behalf of Government.  Portfolio Budget Statements  |   
 
 
Department of Employment and Workplace Relations   |  Page 45 
Total expenses for 2025 –26 are estimated to be $4.8 billion. This is a decrease of $1.3 billion 
from the 2024 –25 estimated actual, mainly driven by the one -off increased expenses in 
2024 –25 as a result of the Building Australia's Future – A fairer deal for students  measure.  
The administered revenue predominately relates to  Coal LSL levies, other non -taxation 
revenue from Trades Recognition Australia’s cost recovery agreement and indexation on 
loan programs administered by the department, which are Australian Apprenticeship 
Support  Loans and VET Student Loans.  
Schedule of budgeted assets and liabilities administered on behalf of Government  
Total administered assets are projected to increase by $5 93.4 million from $3.8 billion as at 
30 June 2026 to $4.4 billion as at 30 June 2029, mainly attributable to the loan programs —
Australian Apprenticeship Support  Loans  and VET Student Loans.  
Total administered liabilities remain relatively stable, increasing marginally from 30 June 
2026 to 30 June 2029.    |  Portfolio Budget Statements

Section 1: Entity overview and reso urces  
1.1 Strategic direction statement  
The Asbestos and Silica Safety and Eradication Agency (ASSEA) was established by the 
Asbestos Safety and Eradication Agency Act 2013 , since amended in December 2023 to the 
Asbestos and Silica Safety and Eradication Agency Act 2013 . 
ASSEA’s key functions under the Act are:  
• encourage, coordinate, monitor and report on the implementation of the Asbestos 
National Strategic Plan and the Silica National Strategic Plan (NSPs)  
• review, amend or replace, publish and promote the NSPs  
• provide advice to the Minister about asbestos safety, asbestos -related diseases, 
silica safety and silica -related diseases  
• collaborate with Commonwealth, state, territory, local and other governments, 
agencies or bodies (including international governments, agencies and bodies) 
regarding the NSPs  
• conduct, commission, monitor and promote research about asbestos safety, 
asbestos -related diseases, silica safety and silica -related diseases  
• raise awareness of asbestos safety, asbestos -related diseases, silica safety and 
silica -related diseases, including developing and promoting materials on asbestos 
safety, asbestos -related diseases, silica safety and silica -related diseases  
• collect and analyse data required for measuring progress on preventing exposure 
to asbestos fibres, or respirable crystalline silica, and for informing evidence -based 
policies and strategies  
• promote consistent messages, policies and practices in relation to asbestos safety, 
asbestos -related diseases, silica safety and silica -related diseases.  
In 2025 –26, ASSEA will progress actions under the Asbestos National Strategic Plan and 
Silica National Strategic Plan and support other lead agencies and partners in delivering 
against the plans. This will include:  
• Engagement with senior level representatives of organisations leading actions in 
the national strategic plans and through the newly established Asbestos and Silica 
Advisory Committees  to enable the work of the Agency and its Council.  
 
   |  Portfolio Budget Statements  
 
Page 62  |  Asbestos and Silica Safety and Eradication Agency   
• Delivery of key research projects that will fill gaps in our understanding , including  
exposure to asbestos fibres in the general environment and in our water systems  
and clarification of the state of labelling for silica in Australia and 
recommendations on application across the silica supply chain.  
• Delivery of targeted awareness campaigns for silica and asbestos supported by 
behavioural insights . 
• Building our local, national and international networks  to share knowledge and 
experiences to influence behavioural change that reduce exposures to asbestos and 
silica.  
Further information is contained in our 2024 –25 Operational Plan and 2025 –26 Operational 
Plan. Our 2024 –25 plan is available on our website ( https://www.asbestossafety.gov.au ) 
whilst the 2025 –26 plan will be available after June 2025.  Portfolio Budget Statements  |

1.2 Entity resource statement  
Table 1.1 shows the total resourcing from all sources available to the Asbestos and Silica 
Safety and Eradication Agency  for its operations and to deliver programs and services on 
behalf of the Government.  
The table summarises how resources will be applied by outcome (government strategic 
policy objectives) and by administered (on behalf of the Government or the public) and 
departmental (for the entity’s operations) classification. ASSEA does not receive any  
administered funding.  
For more detailed information on special accounts and special appropriations, please refer 
to the Budget Paper No. 4 : Agency Resourcing .  
Information in this table is presented on a resourcing (that is, appropriations/cash 
available) basis, whilst the ‘Budgeted expenses by Outcome’ tables in Section 2 and the 
financial statements in Section 3 are presented on an accrual basis. Amounts presen ted 
below are consistent with amounts presented in the Appropriation Bills themselves.    |  Portfolio Budget Statements

Section 2: Outcomes and planned performance  
Government outcomes are the intended results, impacts or consequences of actions by the 
Government on the Australian community. Commonwealth programs are the primary 
vehicle by which government entities achieve the intended results of their outcome 
statements. Entities are required to identif y the programs which contribute to government 
outcomes over the Budget and forward years.  
Each outcome is described below together with its related programs. The following 
provides detailed information on expenses for each outcome and program, further broken 
down by funding source.  
The agency has reviewed its performance measures to provide improved clarity of 
measures and consistency in target descriptions.  
Note:  
Performance reporting requirements in the Portfolio Budget Statements are part of the 
Commonwealth performance framework established by the Public Governance, 
Performance and Accountability Act 2013 . It is anticipated that the performance measure 
described in Portfolio Budget Statements will be read with broader information 
provided in an entity ’s corporate plans and annual performance statements – included in 
Annual Reports  – to provide a complete picture of an entity ’s planned and actual 
performance.  
The most recent corporate plan for  ASSEA  can be found at: 2024 –25 ASSEA Operational 
Plan . 
The most recent annual performance statement can be found in our 2023 –24 Annual 
Report at: 2023 –24 ASSEA Annual Report .

Section 1: Entity overview and reso urces  
1.1 Strategic direction statement  
As Australia’s national regulator of the Vocational Education and Training (VET) sector, 
the Australian Skills Quality Authority’s (ASQA) purpose is to ensure quality VET so that 
students, industry, governments, and the community have confidence in the integrity of 
national qualifications issued by training providers.  
ASQA regulates providers that deliver:  
• VET qualifications and courses to students in Australia  or offer Australian 
qualifications internationally  
• VET courses to overseas students – approved on the Commonwealth Register of 
Institutions and Courses for Overseas Students (CRICOS) to teach overseas 
students on student visas in Australia  
• English Language Intensive Courses for Overseas Students (ELICOS) – approved 
on the CRICOS.  
ASQA accredits VET courses to make sure nationally approved standards are met, based 
on established industry, enterprise, education, legislative or community need.  
ASQA supports confidence in the integrity of national qualifications issued by training 
providers by:  
• ensuring its monitoring, compliance, enforcement, and education activities make 
full use of intelligence and data so that the community are confident that our 
activities are based on risk  
• maintaining essential safeguards by responding adeptly to non -compliance and 
taking effective action, applying a range of compliance and enforcement activities 
proportionate to the level of harm , and  
• using education as a key regulatory tool and providing feedback that enables 
regulated entities to take responsibility for meeting their obligations, and supports 
providers to address risks and monitor, evaluate and continuously improve VET 
outcomes.  
    |  Portfolio Budget Statements  
 
Page 84  |  Australian Skills Quality Authority   
ASQA’s priorities for the year ahead  
ASQA’s priorities for the coming year focus on enhancing the VET sector’s capacity to 
address Australia’s skills needs amidst evolving economic and social challenges. Key 
priorities include:  
• Implementing amendments to the National Vocational Education and Training 
Regulator (NVETR)  Act 2011 that give ASQA greater powers to protect vulnerable 
students, take action against non -genuine providers, and ensure suitability at 
market entry.  
• Through its Integrity Unit, uplifting ASQA’s investigation, enforcement and 
intelligence capability including multi -agency compliance operations.  
• Collaborating with DEWR and stakeholders to prepare for the implementation of 
revised Standards for Registered Training Organisations (RTOs), including

Section 2: Outcomes and planned performance  
Government outcomes are the intended results, impacts or consequences of actions by the 
Government on the Australian community. Commonwealth programs are the primary 
vehicle by which government entities achieve the intended results of their outcome 
stateme nts. Entities are required to identify the programs which contribute to government 
outcomes over the Budget and forward years.  
Each outcome is described below together with its related programs. The following 
provides detailed information on expenses for each outcome and program, further broken 
down by funding source.  
Note:  
Performance reporting requirements in the Portfolio Budget Statements are part of the 
Commonwealth performance framework established by the Public Governance, 
Performance and Accountability Act 2013 . It is anticipated that the performance measure 
described in Portfolio Budget Statements will be read with broader information 
provided in an entity’s corporate plans and annual performance statements – included in 
Annual Reports – to provide a complete p icture of an entity’s planned and actual 
performance.

Section 3: Budgeted financial statements  
Section 3 presents budgeted financial statements which provide a comprehensive snapshot 
of entity finances for the 2025 –26 budget year, including the impact of budget measures 
and resourcing on financial statements.  
3.1 Budgeted financial statements  
3.1.1  Differences between entity resourcing and financial statements  
ASQA has nil differences to report . 
3.1.2  Explanatory notes and analysis of budgeted financial statements

from the 202 4–25 estimated actual. The accumulated deficit of $ 32.3 million in the balance 
sheet predominately represents the accounting treatment applicable to depreciation  
expense.  
Capital acquisitions in 20 25–26 (as shown in Table 3.6) are predominantly planned to be 
$4.5 million for enhancement of IT systems.  
Budgeted assets and liabilities represent net receivables and provisions for refunds of 
administered receipts.  
Schedule of budgeted income and expense administered on behalf of Government  
The administered revenue estimate for 202 5–26 is $36.6 million, a decrease of $0.1 million

1.1 Strategic direction statement  
Comcare  
About Comcare  
Comcare is established under the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988  (SRC Act). 
Comcare has regulatory functions and responsibilities under the SRC Act and Work Health 
and Safety Act 2011  (WHS Act). Comcare also has non -regulatory responsibilities under the 
Asbestos -related Claims (Management of Commonwealth Liabilities) Act 2005 , Parliamentary 
Injury Compensation Scheme Instrument 2016  and the Seafarers Rehabilitation and Compensation 
Act 1992 .  
Comcare is the Commonwealth work health and safety regulator, a workers' compensation 
scheme administrator and an insurer and claims manager. It works with employees and 
employers to minimise the incidence and impact of harm in the workplace, improve 
recov ery and return to work outcomes, and support engagement and better practice 
approaches to health and safety across the Comcare scheme.  
Comcare also provides support through expert advice and services to the Safety, 
Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission (SRCC) and the Seafarers Safety, 
Rehabilitation and Compensation Authority (Seacare Authority).  
Comcare’s purpose and priorities  
Comcare’s purpose is to promote and enable safe and healthy work. Comcare revised its 
strategic direction for 2024 –25 and will focus its efforts and investments to deliver against, 
and make an impact towards, two strategic priorities to achieve its purpose :  
• prevent work related injuries  
• deliver better return to work outcomes.  
These strategic priorities reflect the different functions of Comcare and how we approach 
the prevention – early intervention – injury management – compensation and rehabilitation 
continuum. In delivering on the priorities, Comcare has a focus on psycholog ical injury, to 
respond to the rise in work -related notifications and claims, and to recognise that the 
nature of work and workplaces is evolving.  
   |  Portfolio Budget Statements  
 
Page 110  |  Comcare and the Seafarers Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Authority   
Comcare’s enabling priorities are drivers to building capability and ensure the agency can 
effectively deliver its strategic priorities:  
• making data driven decisions  
• uplifting leadership, effectiveness and efficiency  
• delivering client -centric services.  
Comcare’s foundational value is ‘earning and strengthening trust internally and with our 
stakeholders’.  
In 2025 –26, Comcare will deliver towards its purpose and strategic priorities and monitor 
outcomes of the review of its foundational legislation, the SRC Act. The review commenced 
in 2024 and will address all aspects of the scheme, including governance, us ability and 
entitlements, and provide recommendations to modernise and futureproof the scheme.  
Seafarers Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Authority  
About the Seacare Authority  
The Seacare Authority is a statutory body that takes a leading role in minimising the 
personal and financial costs of workplace injury in the Australian maritime industry. The 
Seacare Authority oversees a national scheme of occupational health and safety ( OHS), 
rehabilitation and workers’ compensation arrangements that applies to defined seafarers 
(referred to as the Seacare scheme). In OHS, the Seacare scheme also applies to other 
defined third parties, such as manufacturers and supply of plant and substan ces used on 
prescribed ships.  
The Seacare Authority has several roles and functions pertaining to the Seacare scheme 
which encompasses the Seafarers Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1992  (Seafarers Act), 
Occupational Health and Safety (Maritime Industry) Act 1993  (OHS(MI) Act), Seafarers 
Rehabilitation and Compensation Levy Act (Levy Act), Seafarers Rehabilitation and Compensation 
Levy Collection Act 1992 (Levy Collection Act) and the regulations made under these Acts.  
The Seacare Authority also manages the Seafarers Safety Net Fund (Fund). The Fund is a 
safety net “employer” to stand in the place of an extant employer if a default event occurs, 
enabling injured seafarers to make a claim against the Fund when there is no  employer 
against whom a claim can be made.

Comcare and the Seafarers Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Authority   |  Page 111 
The Seacare Authority’s purposes and priorities  
The Seacare Authority’s purposes are derived from its functions and powers under the 
Seafarers Act and OHS(MI) Act. These are:  
• Promote healthy and safe workplaces and appropriate and timely compensation for, 
and rehabilitation of, injured workers covered by the Seacare scheme  
•  Maintain a scheme safety net that is able to meet its liabilities.  
The Seacare Authority supports injured workers in the shipping and offshore industry, a 
hazardous industry involving complex operational and safety challenges in very remote 
locations. The Seacare Authority is operating in a climate of fiscal constraint, w hile 
structural changes in the shipping industry in Australia and related insurance markets has 
resulted in a significant decline in the number of scheme participants.  
The Seacare Authority is not a body corporate and does not employ its own staff. To enable 
it to perform its functions and exercise its powers, Comcare provides the Seacare Authority 
with secretariat support and other assistance and makes available the ser vices of such 
members of its staff as the Seacare Authority reasonably requires.    |  Portfolio Budget Statements

Section 2: Outcomes and planned performance  
Government outcomes are the intended results, impacts or consequences of actions by the 
Government on the Australian community. Commonwealth programs are the primary 
vehicle by which government entities achieve the intended results of their outcome 
stateme nts. Entities are required to identify the programs which contribute to government 
outcomes over the Budget and forward years.  
Each outcome is described below together with its related programs. The following 
provides detailed information on expenses for each outcome and program, further broken 
down by funding source.  
Note:  
Performance reporting requirements in the Portfolio Budget Statements are part of the 
Commonwealth performance framework established by the Public Governance, 
Performance and Accountability Act 2013 . It is anticipated that the performance measure 
described in Portfolio Budget Statements will be read with broader information 
provided in an entity ’s corporate plans and annual performance statements – included in 
Annual Reports  – to provide a complete picture of an entity ’s planned and actual 
performance.

Forward Estimates  
2026 –29 As per 2025 –26 As per 2025 –26 
(a)(b) Targets relating to the availability of policies and guidance, as well as seeking stakeholder feedback 
on this guidance, have been removed, with targets to reflect the Seacare Authority’s focus on promotion of 
information based on observable trends.   
The target relating to compliance with reporting has been removed, as the reduction in scheme employers 
has made this difficult to measure. Compliance with reporting obligations will continue to be monitored as 
part of ongoing operations.  
Progression of activities under the Seacare Authority/AMSA OHS Plan has been removed and will be 
monitored as part of the Seacare Authority’s ongoing operations.  
Further detail will be provided through the Seacare Authority’s 2025 –26 Corporate Plan .

Section 3: Budgeted financial statements  
Section 3 presents budgeted financial statements which provide a comprehensive snapshot 
of entity finances for the 2025 –26 budget year, including the impact of budget measures 
and resourcing on financial statements.  
3.1 Budgeted financial statements  
3.1.1  Differences between entity resourcing and financial statements  
The difference between the available resources shown in Table 1.1: Comcare Resource 
Statement and Table 3.1: Comprehensive Income Statement is due to prior year amounts 
available in 202 5–26, and non -cash movements in the value of the workers’ compensation 
claims liability and notional interest receipts. The prior year amounts relate to retained 
premium funds, which are held to discharge future premium claims liabilities.  
Table  3.2: Budgeted Departmental Balance Sheet also includes significant financial asse ts 
(appropriations receivable) which will fund claim payments over the lifetime of the 
outstanding claims liabilities . 
3.1.2  Explanatory notes and analysis of budgeted financial statements  
Income  
Comcare’s total income in 2025 –26 is $424.4 million, compared to $411.7 million in 2024 –25 
(an increase of $12.7 million).  
Expenses  
Comcare’s total expenses in 2025 –26 is $424.4 million, compared to $411.7 million in     
2024 –25 (an increase of $12.7 million).  
Operating result  
Comcare has budgeted for a break -even operating result in 2025 –26. 
Cash  
Comcare’s cash and cash equivalents increased in 2025 –26 from $ 440.8  million 
to $472.5  million (by $ 31.7 million), as premium related income was higher than premium 
related expenses.   
  Portfolio Budget Statements  |   
 
 
Comcare and the Seafarers Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Authority    |  Page 125 
Claims liability  
Comcare has three separate claims liabilities:  
• Premium workers’ compensation claims — these relate to workers’ compensation 
claims from premium -paying agencies with a date of injury on or after 1 July 1989.  
• Pre-premium workers’ compensation claims — these relate to workers’ compensation 
claims with a date of injury before 1 July 1989. It is expected that pre -premium claims 
liabilities will decrease over time as claims are settled.  
• Asbestos -related common law claims — these relate to asbestos -related claims where 
the Commonwealth has a liability.  
In the 2025 –26 Portfolio Budget Statements, all claims liability provisions are based on 
independent actuarial valuations on the basis of the central estimate plus a risk margin that 
would achieve a 75 per cent probability of sufficiency .   |  Portfolio Budget Statements

Section 2: Outcomes and planned performance  
Government outcomes are the intended results, impacts or consequences of actions by the 
Government on the Australian community. Commonwealth programs are the primary 
vehicle by which government entities achieve the intended results of their outcome 
statements. Entities are required to identify the programs which contribute to government 
outcomes over the Budget and forward years.  
Each outcome is described below together with its related programs. The following 
provides detailed information on expenses for each outcome and program, further broken 
down by funding source.  
Note:  
Performance reporting requirements in the Portfolio Budget Statements are part of the 
Commonwealth performance framework established by the Public Governance, 
Performance and Accountability Act 2013 . It is anticipated that the performance measure 
described in Portfolio Budget Statements will be read with broader information 
provided in an entity ’s corporate plans and annual performance statements – included in 
Annual Reports  – to provide a complete picture of an entity ’s planned and actual 
performance.

of entity finances for the 2025 –26 budget year, including the impact of budget measures 
and resourcing on financial statements.  
3.1 Budgeted financial statements  
3.1.1  Differences between entity resourcing and financial statements  
The Commission has no material differences between the entity resourcing and financial 
statements.  
3.1.2  Explanatory notes and analysis of budgeted financial statements  
The Commission is budgeting for an operating loss of $ 5.5 million for the 202 5–26 financial  
year. This figure is equal to the unappropriated depreciation and amortisation expenses  
less the principal repayments on leased assets.   
Total revenues are estimated to be $111.1 million and total expenses $116.8 million in   
2025 –26.   
Total assets at the end of the 202 5–26 year are estimated to be $9 6.1 million. The majority of  
the assets represent receivables (appropriation receivables), property leased assets and  
property fit outs.   
Total liabilities for 202 5–26 are estimated at $5 3.1 million. The largest liability items are  
property lease liabilities and accrued employee entitlements.

depreciat ion/amortisation expenses. For information regarding DCBs, please refer to Table 3.5 Departmental

Section 2: Outcomes and planned performance  
Government outcomes are the intended results, impacts or consequences of actions by the 
Government on the Australian community. Commonwealth programs are the primary 
vehicle by which government entities achieve the intended results of their outcome 
statements. Entities are required to identify the programs which contribute to government 
outcomes over the Budget and forward years.  
Each outcome is described below together with its related programs. The following 
provides detailed information on expenses for each outcome and program, further broken 
down by funding source.  
OFWO has revised its 2024 –25 Corporate Plan, introducing several new performance 
measures for 2025 –26, with continuous efforts to develop further performance measures for 
the forward years.  
Note:  
Performance reporting requirements in the Portfolio Budget Statements are part of the 
Commonwealth performance framework established by the Public Governance, 
Performance and Accountability Act 2013 . It is anticipated that the performance measure 
described in Portfolio Budget Statements will be read with broader information 
provided in an entity ’s corporate plans and annual performance statements – included in 
Annual Reports  – to provide a complete picture of an entity ’s planned and actual 
performance.  
The most recent corporate plan for OFWO  can be found at:

3.1.2  Explanatory notes and analysis of budgeted financial statements  
Departmental  
The Office of the Fair Work Ombudsman is budgeting for a break -even result in 2025 –26, 
after excluding $6.5 million unfunded depreciation and amortisation expenses less the 
principal repayments on leased assets.  
Total revenues are estimated to be $182.6 million and total expenses $189.1 million.  
Total assets at the end of the 2025 –26 financial year are estimated to be $164.4 million. Most 
of the assets represent receivables (appropriations receivable), property leased assets and 
intangibles.  
Total liabilities for 2025 –26 are estimated at $50.6 million. The largest liability items are 
property lease liabilities and accrued employee entitlements.  
Administered  
The 2025 –26 budgeted financial statements have been updated to reflect expense, revenue 
and provision for unclaimed monies following a change in accounting treatment.  The 
change occurred in the 2023 –24 audited financial statements but was not finalised in time 
for inclusion in the 2024 –25 Portfolio Budget Statements.

Section 1: Entity overview and reso urces  
1.1 Strategic direction statement  
Safe Work Australia was established on 1 November 2009 under the Safe Work Australia Act 
2008 (the SWA Act). The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and staff of Safe Work Australia 
constitute a statutory agency for the purposes of the Public Service Act 1999 . The agency also 
operates under the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013  (PGPA Act) 
framework. The CEO manages the agency under section 45 of the SWA Act and is the 
accountable authority in accordance with the PGPA Act.  
Safe Work Australia leads the development of national policy to improve work health and 
safety (WHS) and workers’ compensation arrangements across Australia. The 
establishment of Safe Work Australia was provided for in the Intergovernmental 
Agreement for R egulatory and Operational Reform in Occupational Health and Safety 
(IGA), agreed by the Council of Australian Governments on 3 July 2008.  
The agency is jointly funded by the Commonwealth, state and territory governments. This 
funding arrangement promotes collaboration across and between jurisdictions on evidence 
collection and distribution, policy and strategy development and communication and 
education initiatives. Safe Work Australia has 15 members, including a chair, nine members 
representing the Commonwealth and each state and territory, two members representing 
the interests of employers, two representing the interests of workers and the CEO of Safe 
Work Australia.  
In 2025 –26, Safe Work Australia will continue its work to ensure healthier, safer and more 
productive workplaces through improvements in Australian work health and safety and 
workers’ compensation arrangements , through:  
• continuing to support implementation of the engineered stone prohibition and 
regulation of crystalline silica process, including finalising a review of the prohibition to 
ensure it is operating effectively and preparing new guidance materials including a 
code of practice on managing risks of respirable crystalline silica in the workplace  
• supporting the transition to the new workplace exposure limits, including progressing 
updates to the model WHS laws, guidance and model codes of practice  
• delivering the inaugural research summit focused on national, innovative, and future 
focused research in WHS and workers’ compensation  
• progressing Safe Work Australia’s contribution to delivery of the Asbestos National 
Strategic Plan 2024 –2030 and Silica National Strategic Plan 2024 –2030    |  Portfolio Budget Statements  
 
Page 194  |  Safe Work Australia   
• continuously assessing new and emerging business models, industries and hazards to 
identify if there is a need for changes to the model WHS framework  
• delivering new data insights and fostering innovative and high -quality evidence to 
improve national work health and safety outcomes and workers’ compensation 
arrangements  
• developing and implementing communication strategies that increase awareness of 
WHS fundamentals  
• monitoring the progress of and driving actions in the Australian Work Health and 
Safety Strategy 2023 –2033, and  
• supporting the initiatives in the National Return to Work Strategy 2020 –2030 to improve 
return to work outcomes for workers with a work -related injury or illness, including 
completing the mid -term review of the Strategy.  
Safe Work Australia will continue to be an evidence -based tripartite forum by:  
• bringing together and recognising varying views and interests to ensure effective 
national policies and strategies which improve WHS and workers’ compensation 
outcomes  
• using its influence to increase knowledge and awareness of Australian WHS laws and 
workers’ compensation arrangements  
• supporting the collection, analysis and publication of national WHS and workers’ 
compensation data and research that will address identified knowledge gaps with 
practical and actionable outcomes  
• developing national policy and supporting strategies to improve workers’ 
compensation arrangements, with a particular focus on return to work  
• working with other national and international bodies to share data, information and 
knowledge on WHS and workers’ compensation matters to improve Australian 
outcomes.  
The Safe Work Australia Corporate Plan 2025 –2029 will set out the outcomes to be achieved 
over the forward years and the strategies that will be implemented to achieve them. Safe 
Work Australia’s Operational Plan  2025 –26 will provide further detail on the activities to be 
achieved over the financial year. Both plans are currently being revised, with new versions 
to be published in early 2025 –26. Portfolio Budget Statements  |

Section 2: Outcomes and planned performance  
Government outcomes are the intended results, impacts or consequences of actions by the 
Government on the Australian community. Commonwealth programs are the primary 
vehicle by which government entities achieve the intended results of their outcome 
stateme nts. Entities are required to identify the programs which contribute to government 
outcomes over the Budget and forward years.  
Each outcome is described below together with its related programs. The following 
provides detailed information on expenses for each outcome and program, further broken 
down by funding source.  
Note:  
Performance reporting requirements in the Portfolio Budget Statements are part of the 
Commonwealth performance framework established by the Public Governance, 
Performance and Accountability Act 2013 . It is anticipated that the performance measure 
described in Portfolio Budget Statements will be read with broader information 
provided in an entity ’s corporate plans and annual performance statements – included in 
Annual Reports  – to provide a complete picture of an entity ’s planned and actual 
performance.

to this program, are:  
• Collaborate with the wider work, health and safety and workers’ 
compensation ecosystem to ensure diverse perspectives inform all the 
work we do.  
• Drive regulatory change to protect workers from exposure to harmful 
substances, particularly respirable crystalline silica and asbestos.   
• Respond to emerging WHS issues as work and workplaces continue to 
evolve.  
• Monitor the progress of and drive actions in the  Australian Work Health 
and Safety Strategy 2023 -2033 . 
• Support the  National Return to Work Strategy 2020 –2030  and the actions 
to improve return to work outcomes for workers with a work -related injury 
or illness.  
• Support the collection, analysis and dissemination of national WHS and 
workers’ compensation data that will address identified knowledge gaps 
with practical and actionable outcomes.  
• Significantly enhance our research capability to ensure our policy advice 
on WHS and workers’ compensation is future focussed, and that the 
model WHS legislative framework remains current and can adapt to new 
technologies, industries, and ways of  working.
